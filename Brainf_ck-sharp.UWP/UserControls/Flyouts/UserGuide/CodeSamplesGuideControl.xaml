            <Run Text="To achieve this, it is possible to create two copies of the current value, resetting the current cell, and then move the second copy back to the first cell, to end up with the original value plus a copy in the following cell."/>

            <Run Text="In this example, to print the word &quot;Hello&quot; two loops will be used to set two cells to values closer to the letters that will be printed.
